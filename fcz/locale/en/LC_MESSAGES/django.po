"According to reports, German courts ruled Thursday that Apple, the maker of "
"the iPhone, infringed Qualcomm's hardware patents and that some of Apple's "
"iPhone models with specific components would not be sold in Germany. The "
"judge said that if Apple appealed, the judgment would not take effect "
"immediately.\n"
"Regarding the Qualcomm Apple case in Germany, people familiar with the "
"matter disclosed that there was no accurate information about the Apple "
"models involved in the ban, but the person familiar with the matter believed "
"that the specific model of the lawsuit was not important because the "
"judgment of the German court could cover all relevant models of the patented "
"technology involved, not limited to specific models.\n"
"According to people familiar with the matter, Qualcomm's previous lawsuits "
"in the United States and Germany are also about to come to an end: the "
"German jurisdiction is expected to produce about 4-5 cases next week; two "
"cases in the United States, one about next month, and the other in mid-"
"February.\n"
"In fact, Qualcomm and Apple's \"patent war\" has a long history.\n"
"In July last year, Qualcomm reportedly sued Apple in Munich District Court, "
"Germany, seeking to ban the sale of some of the iPhone models in Germany, "
"while stopping the company's currency losses. At the end of September last "
"year, Qualcomm sued Apple in Beijing Intellectual Property Court for alleged "
"infringement of three patents, demanding a ban on the production and sale of "
"the iPhone in China.\n"
"Recently, with Qualcomm being temporarily banned by the Fuzhou Intermediate "
"Court of China in two cases against Apple, the \"fairy rack\" of the two "
"giants has attracted widespread attention again.\n"
"On the evening of December 10, Qualcomm said that the Fuzhou Intermediate "
"People's Court of China had granted Qualcomm two interim injunctions against "
"four Chinese subsidiaries of Apple, demanding that Apple immediately stop "
"infringing on Qualcomm's two patents, including importing, selling and "
"promising to sell unauthorized products in China. Related products include "
"the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the "
"iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X.\n"
"However, Apple officials immediately responded to the media, trying to ban "
"the sale of Apple products is another desperate move of Qualcomm, Qualcomm's "
"violations are being investigated by regulators around the world, Chinese "
"consumers can still buy all types of iPhone products. After that, Apple "
"applied to Fuzhou Intermediate Court for reconsideration and decided to "
"upgrade its iOS software system.\n"
"According to a report on the 15th, Apple claims that by upgrading its IOS "
"system, it can avoid two infringing Qualcomm patents and avoid the ban. "
"Qualcomm said on Monday that although Apple pushed software updates, it "
"still violated the Chinese court's order to stop selling multiple iPhones.\n"
"Just yesterday (20th), Jiang Hongyi, a lawyer of Beijing Liande Law Firm and "
"a litigation agent entrusted by Qualcomm in Fuzhou Intermediate Court case, "
"also came out to speak. Jiang Hongyi told the media that Apple's attempt to "
"push an upgraded version of IOS to users did not circumvent the court's "
"injunction.\n"
"Jiang Hongyi mentioned that Qualcomm has launched 24 patent infringement "
"lawsuits against Apple in the Chinese market. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has added "
"three new iPhone products released by Apple to the lawsuit."
