"According to reports, German courts ruled Thursday that Apple, the maker of "
"the iPhone, infringed Qualcomm's hardware patents and that some of Apple's "
"iPhone models with specific components would not be sold in Germany. The "
"judge said that if Apple appealed, the judgment would not take effect "
"immediately.\n"
"Regarding the Qualcomm Apple case in Germany, people familiar with the "
"matter disclosed that there was no accurate information about the Apple "
"models involved in the ban, but the person familiar with the matter believed "
"that the specific model of the lawsuit was not important because the "
"judgment of the German court could cover all relevant models of the patented "
"technology involved, not limited to specific models.\n"
"According to people familiar with the matter, Qualcomm's previous lawsuits "
"in the United States and Germany are also about to come to an end: the "
"German jurisdiction is expected to produce about 4-5 cases next week; two "
"cases in the United States, one about next month, and the other in mid-"
"February.\n"
"In fact, Qualcomm and Apple's \"patent war\" has a long history.\n"
"In July last year, Qualcomm reportedly sued Apple in Munich District Court, "
"Germany, seeking to ban the sale of some of the iPhone models in Germany, "
"while stopping the company's currency losses. At the end of September last "
"year, Qualcomm sued Apple in Beijing Intellectual Property Court for alleged "
"infringement of three patents, demanding a ban on the production and sale of "
"the iPhone in China.\n"
"Recently, with Qualcomm being temporarily banned by the Fuzhou Intermediate "
"Court of China in two cases against Apple, the \"fairy rack\" of the two "
"giants has attracted widespread attention again.\n"
"On the evening of December 10, Qualcomm said that the Fuzhou Intermediate "
"People's Court of China had granted Qualcomm two interim injunctions against "
"four Chinese subsidiaries of Apple, demanding that Apple immediately stop "
"infringing on Qualcomm's two patents, including importing, selling and "
"promising to sell unauthorized products in China. Related products include "
"the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the "
"iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X.\n"
"However, Apple officials immediately responded to the media, trying to ban "
"the sale of Apple products is another desperate move of Qualcomm, Qualcomm's "
"violations are being investigated by regulators around the world, Chinese "
"consumers can still buy all types of iPhone products. After that, Apple "
"applied to Fuzhou Intermediate Court for reconsideration and decided to "
"upgrade its iOS software system.\n"
"According to a report on the 15th, Apple claims that by upgrading its IOS "
"system, it can avoid two infringing Qualcomm patents and avoid the ban. "
"Qualcomm said on Monday that although Apple pushed software updates, it "
"still violated the Chinese court's order to stop selling multiple iPhones.\n"
"Just yesterday (20th), Jiang Hongyi, a lawyer of Beijing Liande Law Firm and "
"a litigation agent entrusted by Qualcomm in Fuzhou Intermediate Court case, "
"also came out to speak. Jiang Hongyi told the media that Apple's attempt to "
"push an upgraded version of IOS to users did not circumvent the court's "
"injunction.\n"
"Jiang Hongyi mentioned that Qualcomm has launched 24 patent infringement "
"lawsuits against Apple in the Chinese market. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has added "
"three new iPhone products released by Apple to the lawsuit."
msgstr "据报道，德国法院周四裁定，iPhone制造商苹果侵犯了高通公司的硬件专利，并且苹果的某些带有特定组件的iPhone型号将不会在德国销售。<br/><br/>法官说，如果苹果提起上诉，判决将不会立即生效。关于高通公司在德国的苹果案，知情人士透露，关于禁令涉及的苹果模式没有准确的信息，但知情人士认为，具体的诉讼模式并不重要，因为德国法院的判决可以涵盖所有相关模式。所涉及的专利技术，不限于特定型号。据知情人士透露，高通公司此前在美国和德国的诉讼也即将结束：德国的司法管辖权预计下周将产生约4-5起案件；美国有两起案件，一个在下个月，另一个在2月中旬。事实上，高通和苹果的“专利战争”有着悠久的历史。据报道，去年7月，高通公司在德国慕尼黑地方法院起诉苹果公司，试图禁止在德国销售部分iPhone型号，同时阻止苹果公司的货币损失。去年9月底，高通公司在北京知识产权法院起诉苹果侵犯了三项专利，要求禁止在中国生产和销售iPhone。最近，由于高通公司在两起苹果案中被福州中级法院临时取缔，这两大巨头的“仙女架”再次引起了广泛关注。12月10日晚，高通公司表示，福州市中级人民法院已向高通公司授予两项针对苹果四家中国子公司的临时禁令，要求苹果立即停止侵犯高通公司的两项专利，包括进口、销售和承诺在中国销售未经授权的产品。相关产品包括iPhone 6s、iPhone 6s Plus、iPhone 7、iPhone 7 Plus、iPhone 8、iPhone 8 Plus和iPhone X。然而，苹果官方立即回应媒体，试图禁止销售苹果产品是高通公司另一个绝望的举动，高通公司的违规行为正在世界各地的监管机构调查中，中国消费者仍然可以购买所有类型的iPhone产品。此后，苹果向福州市中级法院申请复议，决定对其iOS软件系统进行升级。根据15日的一份报告，苹果声称通过升级其iOS系统，可以避免两项侵犯高通公司专利的行为，并避免禁令。高通公司周一表示，尽管苹果推出了软件更新，但它仍然违反了中国法院停止销售多部iPhone的命令。就在昨天（20日），北京联德律师事务所律师、高通公司委托的福州市中级法院诉讼代理人蒋宏毅也出来发言。姜宏毅对媒体表示，苹果试图将iOS升级版推向用户，但并未规避法院的禁令。姜宏毅提到，高通公司已在中国市场对苹果提起24起专利侵权诉讼。与此同时，高通公司在诉讼中增加了苹果发布的三款新iPhone产品。"
